## Installation Instructions
- This code was developed under Linux (Debian wheezy, 64 bit) and was tested only in this environment.
- Build Caffe and Python bindings as described in the [official documentation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). You will have to disable CuDNN support and enable C++ 11.
```
$ make all pycaffe
```
- Install Python Click package (required for demo only)		
```
$ pip install click
```
- Set PYTHONPATH variable	
```
$ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/python
```


## Download Caffe Models

 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/eldar/deepcut-cnn.git
$ cd deepcut-cnn
$ cd models/deepercut
$ ./download_models.sh
```

## Run Demo
```
$ cd ../../
$ cd python/pose
$ python ./pose_demo.py image.png --out_name=prediction
```

## Citing
